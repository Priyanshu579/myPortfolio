export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a Front-End Web Developer and Creative Content Creator with a passion for building sleek, interactive web experiences. With solid skills in React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, I create smooth, responsive UIs that not only work great — they feel great. I’ve built animated task managers, cloned real-world websites like Microsoft.com, and love turning ideas into working, beautiful web apps. Beyond code, I run a 5,000+ subscriber YouTube channel where I craft original comedy content, applying digital marketing strategies and SEO to grow my brand. Focused, fast learner, and always up for new challenges — whether it's creating intuitive UIs or experimenting with creative storytelling.`;
